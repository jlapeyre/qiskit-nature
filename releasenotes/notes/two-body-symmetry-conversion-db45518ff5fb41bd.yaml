    Adds utility functions for converting between chemists' and physicists' index ordering
    for two-body integrals. :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.utils.to_chem`
    converts from physicists' or intermediate order to chemists', whereas
    :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.utils.to_phys` converts to physicists'.
    :meth:`qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.utils.find_index_order` returns the
    index-order type for a given two-body tensor.
